* Download Youtube livestreams from the very beginning to the end.
* Monitor a given channel for upcoming livestreams and download them automatically when they become active.

Cookies (in Netscape format) are needed to access membership-only videos as well as age-restricted videos (if you sold your soul to Youtube and your account is "verified").

The example config file is a only a convenience to override the default values, but it is optional.


# Monitoring a channel

It should automatically download a livestream as soon as it is detected in one of these requests.

```
> python3 livestream_saver.py monitor --help

# Merging segments

The *download* sub-command above should automatically merge the downloaded segments once the live stream has ended. If it failed for whatever reason, this sub-command can be invoked on the directory path to the downloaded segments. That directory should be named something like "segments_{VIDEO_ID}".

Basic usage: `python livestream_saver.py merge /path/to/segments_{VIDEO_ID}` (Note to Windows users: use `py livestream_saver.py` instead)

```
> python3 livestream_saver.py merge --help

positional arguments:
  PATH                  Path to directory holding vid/aud sub-directories in which segments have been downloaded as well as the metadata.txt file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        Log level. (Default: INFO)
  -c CONF_FILE, --conf-file CONF_FILE
                        Path to config file to use. (Default: $(pwd)/livestream_saver.cfg)
  -d, --delete-source   Delete source files (vid/aud) once final merging of streams has been successfully done. (default: False)
  -k, --keep-concat     Keep concatenated intermediary files even if merging of streams has been successful. This is only useful for debugging. (default: False)
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Output directory where to write final merged file. (default: None)
```

# Dependencies

* python3.8
* [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)
* ffmpeg to concatenate segments and merge them into one file 
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) (optional) to convert webp thumbnail

# Installation

Either install dependencies system-wide (requires root privileges, use `sudo`):
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
Or create a virtual environment and install the dependencies inside it, but do note that in this case you will need to activate the venv everytime you need to run the program.
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
One could also clone the corresponding repositories manually to get the latest updates.

## Configuration

The template config file is provided as an example. Options can generally be overriden via command line arguments.

### Notifications via e-mail

The e-mail options can be overriden via environment variables if you find it more secure.
Login and password are not mandatory. That depends on your smtp server configuration.
You can send a test e-mail notification with this sub-command: 
```
livestream_saver.py test-notification
```
Whenever a crash, or an error occurs, the program should send you a notification at the configured e-mail address via the configured smtp server.

# Notes:

This is beta software. It should work, but in case it doesn't, feel free to report issues. Or better yet, fix them yourself and submit a merge request. Keep in mind that these mega corporations love to break our things out of spite.

# TODO

* Better stream quality selection (webm, by fps, etc.).
* Add proxy support.
* Fetch segments in parallel to catch up faster.
* Make sure age-restricted videos are not blocked (we rely on Pytube for this).
* Monitor Twitch channels.
* Integrate yt-dlp and streamlink as secondary back-ends.
* Add user-supplied command after merge successful.
* Make Docker image and a web-interface.
